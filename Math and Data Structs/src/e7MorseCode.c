int main (int argc, char* argv[]) {

  return 0;
}

// Idea for how to complete:
// Have a stcuct that contains all of the morse alphabet.
// Check the input for every dah and dit entered, and store that in a temp array.
// Check the temp array against the struct, find the letter, and add it to the ans.
// Repeat until '\0' is found.
