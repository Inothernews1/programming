# Jonah Sussman's C/C++ Programming Repository
## The heck is this?
This repository contains my works which I made in C/C++. Anything that I feel to not fit into a project of its own will go in here. Feel free to poke around and use some of the code! Be warned! Although I try to document my code as best as I can, there is no guarantee that it will be stellar.

## Why are there so many changes!
I like to code. What can I say? `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
